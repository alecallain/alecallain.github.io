# alecallain.github.io
This repository allows me to run a website via GitHub pages. 
I am planning to build out more of the website using React, but there's limitiations with GitHub pages so I need to make a new repo just for the app. 

When it's up and functional, the link will be as follows: https://alecallain.github.io/main

It contains some HTML with Bootstrap just as a placeholder
